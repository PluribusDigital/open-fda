# Thanks, Open Source!

We were able to rapidly create this prototype, in large part because of the many high-quality, freely available open source components available, such as:

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - JavaScript rich-client front-end application framework
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) - interactive data-driven visualizations
* [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) - API documentation
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - back-end web application framework built on the Ruby programming language
* [Python](http://www.python.org/) - flexible programming language used here to import and transform data
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) - database
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - container
* [NGINX](http://nginx.org/) - web server

We generally follow the style and conventions laid out in the (very well done) [Angular Rails](http://angular-rails.com/) online book by David Bryant Copeland.

Of course, there are many more code libraries and modules that we made use of. The best source to see these is really the respective package management files (`Gemfile`, `bower.json`, `package.npm`, and `gruve/setup.py`).
