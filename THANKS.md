# Thanks, Open Source!

We were able to rapidly create this prototype, in large part because of the many high-quality, freely available open source components available, such as:

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - JavaScript rich-client front-end application framework
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) - interactive data-driven visualizations
* [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) - API documentation
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - back-end web application framework built on the Ruby programming language
* [Python](http://www.python.org/) - flexible programming language used here to import and transform data
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) - database

We generally follow the style and conventions laid out in the (very well done) [Angular Rails](http://angular-rails.com/) online book by David Bryant Copeland.
